                    Land may be acquired in Nigeria through any of the following means:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Family land under customary law, by allotment or apportionment: see Supreme Court decision in Sadikwu v. Dalori (1995) 5 N. W.L.R (pt. 504) p.122
                      </li>
                    <li>Allocation of state lanmd by the governor</li>

                    <li>By gift inter vivos. See Supreme Court decision in Imah V Okogbe (1993) 2 S.C.N.J.57</li>
                    <li>By purchase from a person holding land by virtue of 1 - 3 above</li>
                    <li>By inheritance from a person holding land by virtue of 1 - 3 above</li>
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                   When all the interest comprised in land is acquired by purchase, the transaction is referred to as an assignment of interest in land (i.e. the seller, called "the assignor" assigns his interest in the particular land to the purchaser called "the assignee"), or' conveyance of title in land (i.e. the seller conveys his title in a particular land to the seller. Where a sale of land transaction is evidenced in written under deed, then document is known as Deed of Assignment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Where however the purchaser does not acquire all the interests comprised in the land, so that the purchaser's interest will expire at a time earlier than the expiration of the seller's interest in the land, the transaction is known as a lease or sub-lease (the latter being the appropriate term if the seller holds his interest by way of a lease). The document comprising such a transaction is either a Deed of Lease or a Deed of Sub-lease
                </p>

                <p>
                    Deeds of Assignments and Deeds of Lease or Deeds of Sub-lease are all referred to as Deeds of Conveyance to the extent that they transfer the legal estate in land from the seller to the purchaser.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Where however the transaction does not operate to transfer the legal estate, i.e. it is not comprised in a Deed of Conveyance, the document in which the transaction is comprised is known as an Agreement to Sell Land

                </p>

                <p>

                    By sections 2 and 8(2) of Land Instruments (Preparation and Registration) Law Cap 100, Revised Laws of Ebonyi State 2004 (LIPRL), a Deed of Assignment or Deed of Conveyance or an Agreement to Sell are a registrable instruments, and registrable in the Lands Registry, Enugu, Ebonyi State.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All land ownership transactions should be registered in the Deeds Registry. This is to ensure that the State Government at every point in time has accurate records of title status of all lands within its jurisdiction as well as to serve as reference point for members of the public who may be interested in knowing about the existenceof any rights over land in the State.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Also registration of the title documents has a number of advantages. These include:
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                    <li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                      Registration confers priority among persons who may have competing claims over the same land
                </li>
              </ul>
